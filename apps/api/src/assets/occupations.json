The zoo collection, trade, and transport of the animals is regulated by government agencies as well as guided by zoo membership organisations.

Their design is influenced by and influences other designs and must be conform with these designs and the overall artistic vision. Therefore, the designers work closely with artistic directors, operators and the artistic team. Make-up and hair designers develop sketches, design drawings or other documentation to support the workshop and performance crew. Make-up designers sometimes also work as autonomous artists, creating make-up art outside a performance context."

They focus on enquiry-based, democracy-implementing and cooperative learning methods. They adhere to a specific curriculum that incorporates these learning methods through which students use trial and error practices in order to develop their own interests in a democratic, self-government context. Freinet school teachers also encourage students to practically create products and provide services in and outside of class, usually handcrafted or personally initiated, implementing the 'pedagogy of work' theory. They manage and evaluate all the students separately according to the Freinet school philosophy."
